    "## Baseline-Centered Rare-Link Sampling for WLNM\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "We refine the train/test split used by WLNM to systematically evaluate the effect of **rare ecological interactions** in training. Instead of choosing training links purely at random, we (i) estimate how many rare links would enter training **under a Random split**, and (ii) **center the RareLinks sweep around that empirical baseline**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Connectivity & Rarity Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Directed connectivity (per node):**\n",
    "  $\\deg^{out}(i) = \\sum_j A_{ij},\\quad \\deg^{in}(i) = \\sum_j A_{ji},\\quad \\deg(i)=\\deg^{out}(i)+\\deg^{in}(i)$\n",
    "* **Edge rarity score (per link $i\\to j$):**\n",
    "  $r_{ij} = \\deg(i)+\\deg(j)$ (lower $r_{ij}$ ⇒ rarer interaction).\n",
    "* **Rare set (quantile-based):**\n",
    "  For all observed links, compute $r_{ij}$ and mark the bottom $q$ proportion as **rare** (default $q=0.20$).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Baseline Estimation (Random Strategy)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each food web and train ratio:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute the **rare set** using the rarity definition above (on the full observed network).\n",
    "2. Repeat **Random** train/test splitting for $T$ runs (same directed logic and optional reachability constraint as used in WLNM preprocessing).\n",
    "3. For each run, record the **fraction of rare links** that fall into the training set.\n",
    "4. **Baseline** = mean of these fractions across the $T$ runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We log one CSV per food web (rare fraction under Random) and a per-ratio summary (mean baseline across food webs).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale.** This yields a dataset-specific, train-ratio-specific reference for how many rare links a purely random split would include, accounting for any reachability constraints in the split procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Baseline-Centered RareLinks Sweep\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\hat{\\rho}$ be the Random baseline fraction for a dataset at a given train ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define a sweep range\n",
    "  $[\\,\\max(\\rho_{\\min}, \\hat{\\rho}-w),\\, \\min(\\rho_{\\max}, \\hat{\\rho}+w)\\,]$\n",
    "  with step $\\Delta$ (defaults: $w=0.05$, $\\Delta=0.01$, $\\rho_{\\min}=0.01$, $\\rho_{\\max}=0.50$).\n",
    "* Each sweep point sets **RareFraction** = proportion of training links drawn from the rare set; the remainder is filled from non-rare links.\n",
    "\n",
    "This anchors the exploration to a **realistic center** (what Random already gives) while testing controlled over/under-representation of rare interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Train/Test Selection Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Random Strategy (Reference)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Input:** directed network $A$, train ratio $\\alpha$.\n",
    "* **Procedure:** uniformly sample links for test until reaching $(1-\\alpha)|E|$, optionally preserving a reachability constraint (if removing a link would sever a required path, skip it). The remaining links form training.\n",
    "* **Output:** $A_{\\text{train}}, A_{\\text{test}}$.\n",
    "* **Use:** Baseline performance; baseline rare-fraction estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 RareLinks Strategy (Baseline-Centered)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Input:** $A$, train ratio $\\alpha$, rare set (bottom $q$), RareFraction $\\rho$.\n",
    "* **Procedure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Compute $r_{ij}$ and sort links ascending (rarest first).\n",
    "  2. Target training size $m=\\lceil \\alpha |E| \\rceil$.\n",
    "  3. Select $\\lceil \\rho m\\rceil$ links from the rare set (starting from the rarest), then fill the remaining $m-\\lceil \\rho m\\rceil$ slots from the other links.\n",
    "  4. The **test set** is $E \\setminus E_{\\text{train}}$.\n",
    "* **Output:** $A_{\\text{train}}, A_{\\text{test}}$.\n",
    "* **Note:** The selection itself does not enforce a reachability check (consistent with our current implementation); connectivity effects are reflected in the Random baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Hyperparameters (defaults used here)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rare quantile $q=0.20$.\n",
    "* Baseline sweep band $w=0.05$ and step $\\Delta=0.01$, clamped to $[0.01, 0.50]$.\n",
    "* Number of Random repeats $T$ for baseline = number of experiments (can be set higher for a more stable baseline).\n",
    "* Directed logic; optional reachability check in Random baseline (adaptive off for $n\\ge 30$, off for small $n$).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Outputs & Logging\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Per-web baseline CSV:** `Foodweb, TrainRatio, RareQuantile, RandomTrainRareFraction`.\n",
    "* **Per-ratio summary CSV:** `TrainRatio, NumFoodwebs, MeanRandomRareFraction`.\n",
    "* **Performance logs (per strategy):** AUC, best threshold, Precision/Recall/F1, $K$, TrainRatio; RareLinks also logs RareFraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Computational Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computing rarity scores is $O(|E|)$; sorting for the rare set is $O(|E|\\log|E|)$.\n",
    "* Random baseline adds $T$ train/test splits (linear in $|E|$ with possible rejections due to reachability).\n",
    "* RareLinks selection is dominated by one sort and linear scans to fill quotas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Expected Behaviour & Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Random** provides an unbiased reference both for performance (AUC/F1) and for the typical rare-link fraction in training.\n",
    "* **Baseline-centered RareLinks** probes how nudging the rare-link share above/below that reference impacts prediction—often improving recall for rare interactions while potentially trading off precision on common links.\n",
    "* Centering the sweep on $\\hat{\\rho}$ prevents arbitrary ranges and makes cross-web comparisons more principled.\n",
