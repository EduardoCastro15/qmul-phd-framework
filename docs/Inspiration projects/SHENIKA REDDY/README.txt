This folder contains supporting material for each aspect of the project. 

Eco_Datasets includes all ecological network datasets, including the original dataset and filtered versions.
Soc_Datasets includes the nodes and edges lists for the social network graph. 
Results includes csv files for centrality, similarity, embedding and prediction results.
Python includes the Jupyter notebooks used for data cleaning, filtering and visualisation of results.
Cypher includes the cypher codes used in Neo4j desktop to implement all graph analysis algorithms.

To run Jupyter notebooks, Google Colab was used. The csv files can be uploaded onto Colab and then the code can be run.
To run Cypher code, Neo4j desktop is most simple. The datasets would have to be imported, then the code can be used to create the graphs and run the algorithms.
