Aug08_final_links.csv README



In brief, the IS column contains a code for the 14 Icelandic Streams we studied, temperature is in the temp column, and consumer / resource taxonomic names, body mass (in mg), and abundance (individuals m^-2) follow in the next six columns. Source describes whether the links were identified from gut content analysis from that specific stream, from the Hengill region, or from the literature, and the final column describes whether the links are specific to the consumer species or a higher taxonomic level.
