function [train, test] = DivideNet(net, ratioTrain)
    % Divide a directed network into training and testing sets,
    % preserving directionality and removing self-loops.
    %
    % --Input--
    %   net:        n x n binary adjacency matrix (directed)
    %   ratioTrain: fraction of links to retain in training set (e.g., 0.9)
    %
    % --Output--
    %   train:      directed training adjacency matrix
    %   test:       directed testing adjacency matrix
